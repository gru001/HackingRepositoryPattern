# HackingRepositoryPattern

Demonstrate Model–view–Presenter (MVP) pattern and Repository pattern using Android API.

### Repository Pattern ###
Separates data access logic and maps it to
the entities in th business logic. It works with the domain entities and
performs data access logic. In the Repository pattern, the domain entities,
the data access logic and the business logic talk to each other using interfaces.
It hides the details of data access from the business logic. In other
words, business logic can access the data object without having knowledge
of the underlying data access architecture.
